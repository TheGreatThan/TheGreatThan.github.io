        <h1>“CHỊ DÂU” – A BOLD SLAP OF FAMILY DRAMA THAT’LL LEAVE YOU SHOOK</h1>
        <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%; font-size: 20px;">"Chị Dâu" is that movie. You think you’re walking into another tired, cliché “sister-in-law vs. sister-in-law” 
            soap opera? Think again. This film doesn’t just serve drama; it drags out all the skeletons in the closet, dusts them off, and throws them right in your face. 
            And somehow, it manages to make you laugh, cry, and clutch your pearls, all while unraveling some deeply buried family wounds. Therapy? Nah. Just go watch this.</p>
        <img src="/FilmsReview/rv/chidau/anh/2-17349200420891664814179.webp" alt="A Scence From 'Chi Dau'">
        <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%; font-size: 20px;">Set against the backdrop of a very chaotic family memorial gathering, the story dives headfirst into intergenerational conflicts. 
            The sister-in-law (Việt Hương) has to deal with not one, not two, but FOUR wildly different sisters-in-law (Hồng Đào, Đinh Y Nhung, Lê Khánh, Ngọc Trinh), each with their own 
            baggage and attitude. Spoiler alert: none of them come in peace. It’s like watching a fire slowly burn down a house, except the house is the family’s fragile dynamic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="review">
        <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%; font-size: 20px;">The opening 15 minutes? Pure setup perfection. We get a glimpse into everyone’s lives: one’s a gold shop boss juggling family pride and ancestral duties, while the others 
            are out there doing the most—from running cosmetic clinics to freelancing their way through life. They’re all thrown together to decide the fate of their ancestral home, 
            which, surprise, is falling apart—just like their relationships. Cue the bickering, secrets spilling, and passive-aggressive comments that hit harder than a slap.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%; font-size: 20px;"><i><b>The Drama Level? Off the Charts.
        </b></i> <br>Director Khương Ngọc knew exactly what he was doing here. The film traps you in a single day of family chaos, with tension so thick you could cut it with a rusty knife. 
            The memorial dinner devolves into a battlefield of exposed insecurities, jealousy, and resentment. But it’s not just the petty stuff—it’s the deep-rooted issues. The 
            eldest sister-in-law is accused of being a show-off, the youngest is labeled a money-leech, and everyone else is too caught up in their own misery to offer any olive branches. 
            Oh, and the men in their lives? Barely relevant but somehow still the root of all their problems. Classic.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%; font-size: 20px;"><b><i>What Stands Out? The Cast.
        </i></b> <br>Việt Hương absolutely nails her role as the eldest sister-in-law trying to hold it together while everyone else is falling 
            apart. Hồng Đào’s portrayal of a bitter, disillusioned sibling hits home, while Lê Khánh and Ngọc Trinh bring the perfect mix of sass and vulnerability. Each actor gets their moment to 
            shine, and trust me, when those emotional punches land, they<em> sting.</em></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%; font-size: 20px;"><b><i>A Storm—Both Literal and Metaphorical.</i></b> <br>As if the family drama wasn’t messy enough, a literal storm hits the house towards the end. The crumbling house becomes a metaphor for their fractured relationships, and the chaos forces 
            them to confront their pain, regret, and—wait for it—love for each other. The final scene, with the sisters huddled together under the ruins of their old home, sharing a simple meal, is 
            the kind of gut punch that leaves you ugly crying in the theater. <b>Yes, I cried. And no, I won’t apologize.</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="nv">
        <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%; font-size: 20px;"><b><i>To conclude</i></b> <br> If you’re into movies like "Nhà Bà Nữ" or "Lật Mặt 7," “Chị Dâu” will hit the spot. It’s messy, emotional,
             and downright raw in the best way possible. The film dives deep into family trauma but somehow leaves you 
             with a weird sense of hope. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll probably call your family afterward—just 
             to make sure they’re not secretly plotting against you (lol). <b>9/10 would recommend.</b></p>
