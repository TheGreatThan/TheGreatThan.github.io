        <h1>“ĐÈN ÂM HỒN” – A Hauntingly Beautiful Misfire That’s More “Boo-Hoo” Than “Boo!</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Let’s set the scene: Đèn âm hồn, a film that promises to blend Vietnamese folklore with spiritual chills, is like a meticulously carved jack-o’-lantern—gorgeous to look at, but hollowed out and missing the candle. Inspired by the tragic classic Chuyện người con gái Nam Xương, director Hoàng Nam’s debut flick tries to juggle ghostly intrigue, feminist themes, and a splash of Exhuma-style exorcism drama. Sadly, the script haunts itself more than the ghosts do.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>The Good (Because We’re Nice Like That)</b> <br> 
            Visually, this movie is a love letter to Vietnam’s rugged beauty. Sweeping shots of Thác Bản Giốc waterfall and misty Cao Bằng mountains? Check. A painstakingly recreated rural village with thatch-roofed homes and bustling markets? Double-check. The film’s aesthetic is so lush, you’ll want to frame it—or at least bookmark it for your next Instagram vs. Reality post. And let’s give a shoutout to the ritual scenes! Watching shaman Liễu (Hoàng Kim Ngọc) whip straw dolls with mulberry branches and chant curses is the kind of chaotic energy we’re here for. Think Insidious’ Elise meets Midsommar, but with more phở and fewer flower crowns.</p>

    <div class="review">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>The Not-So-Good (Brace Yourselves)</b> <br> Alas, Đèn âm hồn’s script is as disjointed as a ghost missing its limbs. The first act sets up a poignant tale of Thương (Diễm Trang), a loyal wife left to care for her son while her husband Đinh (Phú Thịnh) is at war. But once Đinh returns—suspicious, shirtless, and emotionally constipated—the plot spirals into a swamp of melodrama. The “spooky” elements? More meh than malevolent. Forget jumpscares—this film’s biggest fright is realizing you’ve been waiting 40 minutes for something to happen.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><i>The characters’ logic is… well, let’s just say even the ghosts are confused. When accused of infidelity, Thương doesn’t defend herself—she opts for a dramatic river plunge. Đinh’s response? Jumping shirtless into the same river (to rescue her? To flex? The world may never know). Audiences reportedly giggled at this Baywatch-meets-The Conjuring moment, proving that even in 19th-century Vietnam, abs were a priority.</p>

    <div class="new">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b><i>The “Bless Their Hearts” Department
        </i></b> <br>The acting? Let’s call it “enthusiastically amateur.” Diễm Trang’s portrayal of Thương’s suffering has all the emotional depth of a rice puddle, while Phú Thịnh’s Đinh delivers lines with the passion of a man reading a grocery list. The dialogue doesn’t help—imagine Shakespearean tragedy rewritten by a TikTok script generator. (“Hark, my son! Beholdeth… checks notes… this shadow-daddy on the wall!”)</p>
            <img src="/FilmsReview/rv/denamhon/source/denamhonanh2.webp" alt="A Scence From 'Chi Dau'">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b><i>Box Office Magic (Because Irony is Alive)</i></b> <br>Despite its flaws, Đèn âm hồn raked in 60 billion VND in five days, proving that sometimes, a pretty lantern is all you need to lure crowds. It even outperformed Trấn Thành’s Bộ tứ báo thủ—a feat as shocking as finding out the quiet kid in class secretly runs a meme page.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nv">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b><i>To conclude</i></b> <br> Đèn âm hồn is a cinematic phở—visually appetizing, but under-seasoned and missing the beef. Director Hoàng Nam (a vlogger-turned-filmmaker whose Challenge Me series is legitimately cool) clearly has passion. Sadly, passion doesn’t fix plot holes or stiff acting. But hey, he’s already teasing a sequel! Maybe Part Two will give us the ghostly smackdowns and emotional depth this film promises. Until then, enjoy it for the scenery… and the unintentional abs-comedy.</p>
        <p>Rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars. (One for the cinematography, one for the mulberry-branch rituals, and half a star for Phú Thịnh’s dedication to shirtless heroism.)✨</p>
